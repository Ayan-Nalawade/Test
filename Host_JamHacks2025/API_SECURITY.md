# API Key Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the approach used to secure API keys in the Google Docs-like application with DocsGPT AI integration. Since the application is frontend-only as per requirements, special care has been taken to ensure sensitive information is not exposed to the public.

## Security Approach

### 1. Environment Variables

We use environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys. The application uses Vite's built-in environment variable handling with the following security measures:

- Only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client-side code
- A `.env.example` file is provided as a template, but actual keys should be stored in `.env.local` (which is gitignored)
- The actual API keys are never committed to the repository

### 2. Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.ts` file has been configured to:

- Only expose environment variables that start with `VITE_` prefix
- Set up path aliases for cleaner imports
- Provide a proxy configuration option for API requests if needed in the future

### 3. Runtime Security

For the Gemini API integration:

- The API key is loaded from environment variables at runtime
- Error handling is implemented to prevent exposing sensitive information in error messages
- API requests are made directly from the client as required by the frontend-only architecture

### 4. Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying this application:

1. Never commit `.env.local` files containing actual API keys to version control
2. Set environment variables directly on the hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. Consider implementing rate limiting on the API key if supported
4. Regularly rotate API keys as a security best practice

### 5. Alternative Approaches (if needed)

If higher security is required in the future, consider:

- Implementing a lightweight backend service to proxy API requests
- Using serverless functions to handle sensitive API calls
- Implementing token-based authentication for API access

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses:

- `dotenv-webpack` for environment variable management
- Vite's environment variable system with the `VITE_` prefix convention
- Google's official `@google/generative-ai` package for API integration

## User Instructions

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your actual API keys to `.env.local`
3. Never commit `.env.local` to version control
4. When deploying, set the environment variables on your hosting platform
